          The average flight delay between US domestic flights is <b>9 minutes</b>. However, this is simple average calculation and cannot be trusted always.

            From the chart above, average flight delays appear to be inversely related to the volume
            of flights happening in a given hour. It can be observed that, <b>hours with the highest number of flights also have
            the lowest average delay times</b>. There seems to be one exception though, at 4am
            there is a relatively low volume of flights and a low average delay time. This pattern may be attributed to the fact of having less number of support staff during odd operating hours.
